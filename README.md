# bylaws_pghdeafclub
Bylaws of the Pittsburgh Association of the Deaf, Inc.

The original bylaws were imported by converting pdf to text and adding LaTeX markups to structure the document.

The environment I'm using to compile the LaTeX document is Ubuntu Linux, with packages texlive, texlive-latex-extra, and texlive-publishers.  Run the command 
```console
$ pdflatex bylaws.tex
```

Windows users may want to look at [TeXLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/)

You may need to compile twice in order to get the table of contents generated properly.
